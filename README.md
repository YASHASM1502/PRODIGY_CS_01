🔐 **Task 1 Completed – Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption 

📌 **Project Title**: Caesar Cipher – Text Encryption & Decryption
🧠 **Description**:
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques used in cryptography. In this task, I developed a Python program that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt messages** using a shift-based substitution algorithm. The tool maintains non-alphabetic characters (like spaces or punctuation) and works for both uppercase and lowercase letters.

🔧 **Features**:

* User input for message and shift key
* Case-sensitive encryption (handles both uppercase and lowercase)
* Preservation of non-alphabetic characters
* Simple & user-friendly interface in the terminal
* Both encryption and decryption handled through reusable functions

🛠️ **Technologies Used**:

* Python (Core Programming)
* String manipulation
* Conditional logic
* ASCII character handling (`ord()` and `chr()` functions)
* Modular function design

💡 **Key Learnings**:

* Working with classic cryptographic algorithms
* Implementing clean, reusable functions in Python
* Enhancing command-line interaction for better user experience
